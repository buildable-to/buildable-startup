# Customer Interview Script

*Based on Mom Test principles — ask about their life, not your product.*

## Before the Interview
- [ ] Know the company name, size, and what they build
- [ ] Have the tracking sheet open
- [ ] Record (with permission) or take detailed notes with exact quotes

## Opening (2 min)
"Thanks for taking the time. We're researching how precast companies handle their design and drawing workflow. I'd love to hear how things work at [company]. There are no right or wrong answers — I just want to understand your process."

## Core Questions (20 min)

### Workflow
1. **Walk me through what happens when you get a new order.** Who does what, in what order?
2. **How long does the design/drawing phase take** vs actual production/construction?
3. **Who does the drawings?** In-house engineers? Outsourced? How many people?

### Tools
4. **What tools do you use for drawings?** (AutoCAD, manual, Tekla, other?)
5. **What do you hate about your current tools?**
6. **Have you tried any new tools or software in the last year?** What happened?

### Pain & Cost
7. **How much do you spend on design software per year?** (licenses, training, etc.)
8. **When was the last time a drawing error caused rework?** What happened? What did it cost?
9. **If a drawing needs changes after approval, how long does that take?**

### The Magic Wand
10. **If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your drawing process, what would it be?**

## Closing (5 min)
"This has been really helpful. A few last questions:"
- Would you be open to trying a new tool if it could cut your drawing time significantly?
- Who else at your company would I want to talk to about this?
- Can I follow up in a few weeks to show you what we're building?

## After the Interview
- [ ] Fill in the tracking sheet immediately (don't wait)
- [ ] Write down exact quotes (not paraphrases)
- [ ] Note body language / enthusiasm level
- [ ] Identify the #1 pain point from this conversation
- [ ] Send a thank-you message within 24 hours

## Red Flags (things that mean you're doing it wrong)
- You're talking more than the interviewee
- You mentioned Buildable in the first 15 minutes
- You asked "would you use this?" (future prediction = unreliable)
- You're getting compliments instead of specifics
- You feel good after the interview but have no actionable data
