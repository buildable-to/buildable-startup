*Post 3x/week. Focus on the PROBLEM, not the product.*

## Post Ideas

### Week 1
- [ ] "A precast company told me their design phase takes 2 months. Construction takes 15 days. How is this still normal in 2026?"
- [ ] "I asked 5 structural engineers what they hate most about their job. Every single one said: drawings."
- [ ] "The precast industry is worth $150B. The tools most companies use? AutoCAD from 1982 and Excel."

### Week 2
- [ ] "One drawing error on a precast element can cost $10K+ in rework. How much does your company lose per year?"
- [ ] "BIM was supposed to fix construction. So why are structural engineers still manually drawing rebar details?"
- [ ] "I visited a precast factory last week. They have $5M worth of CNC machinery... controlled by hand-drawn sketches."

### Week 3
- [ ] "Tekla costs $10-20K per seat per year. Most Georgian precast companies use AutoCAD and prayer."
- [ ] "What if structural drawings could update themselves when one dimension changes?"
- [ ] "Bar bending schedules: the most boring, error-prone, critical document in precast. Why hasn't anyone automated this?"

### Ongoing Themes
- Day-in-the-life of a structural engineer
- Cost of errors / rework stories (from interviews)
- Technology gap in construction vs other industries
- Questions that drive engagement ("How do you handle...?")

## Rules
- Under 200 words per post
- Ask a question at the end
- No product pitching until we have the demo video
- Use Nikoloz's real stories as raw material
- Tag relevant industry people
