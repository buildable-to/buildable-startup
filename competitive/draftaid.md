# DraftAid (draftaid.io) — Competitive Teardown

*Status: evaluated*

## Overview
- **Funding:** $500K+ (YC 2024 Winter) 
- **Approach:** AI 2D drawing automation from 3D models — "GitHub Copilot for CAD drawings"
- **Target:** Engineers who produce 2D drawings from 3D models

## What They Do Well
Automatically create 2D drawings from 3D models in minutes with minimal human interference. Process is super easy and does 15 minutes work in 2 minutes. Easy intergrations with CAD systems

## What They Do Poorly
They are only focused on manufacturing engineers and automate only each parts 2D drawings creation process, not complex processes for construction professionals. 

## Pricing
TBD ???

## Why This Is the Closest Competitor
DraftAid is the only other startup focused on 2D drawing automation. Key difference: they derive from 3D models, Buildable generates 2D directly. They are doing 2D drawings for manufacturing parts and engineers, not for construction engineers. 

## Key Takeaway
They are just manufacturing part's 2D drawings generator right now and have not expanded for 2 years, but they are growing well in their niche. I don't think they will pivot, because they grew from 10k to 210k drawings yearly in their niche and are not raising more capital extend their functionality.
