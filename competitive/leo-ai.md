# Leo AI (getleo.ai) — Competitive Teardown

*Status: evaluated*

## Overview
- **Funding:** $9.7M total funding (Flint, a16z scout)
- **Approach:** "Large Mechanical Model" — engineering knowledge copilot
- **Target:** Mechanical engineering, 60K+ users, HP/Siemens/Mobileye clients

## First-Hand Evaluation
- [x] Requested demo
- [x] Documented their approach
- [x] Followed on linkedin

## What They Do Well
AI CAD for mechanical engineers. They are good in idea/concept testing and their AI gets information from verified sources which makes it accurate and trustworth. Also they have a great searching for parts automatic system with 12M+ items in library. 

## What They Do Poorly
After testing concept, engineers still have to use CAD system for 100% accurate 3D models and 2D drawings. 

## Pricing
Not mentioned ????

## Could They Pivot to Precast?
TBD highly unlikely. their focus is on mechanical engineering. Founders are mechanical engineers and their future goals and features are all about improving quality of 3D models creation. 

## Key Takeaway
Strong team, strong back and good performance. They have their niche in mechanical engineering and they are staying there. No plan to explore other areas yet as I checked, but still followed them and will check once in a while.
