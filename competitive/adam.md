## What They Do Well
3D model generation. They made path from idea in our head to the 3D model easier. 

## What They Do Poorly
it can create 2D projections of 3D models, which gives us flat outlines (top, front, side views). However, It can't produce traditional engineering drawings with dimension lines, title blocks, or annotations like dedicated drafting software (e.g., AutoCAD or SolidWorks). 

## Pricing
Subscription based model.
Standard-$9.99/month; pro-$29.99/month; enterprise-custom price, talk with CEO. 

## Could They Pivot to Precast?
No, Their users as I see are thinkers and idea generator people: 3D printer users, creators... so there is a low chance of pivot. 

## Key Takeaway
Great founders, great social media presence & marketing. Focused on 3D models and unlikely to pivot as they are growings well. 
strong indirect competitors.
