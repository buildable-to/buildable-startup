# Zoo.dev (ex-KittyCAD) — Competitive Teardown

*Status: evaluated*

## Overview
- **Funding:** $10.1M (Sequoia)
- **Approach:** New CAD from scratch, custom language (KCL), custom engine
- **Target:** General CAD, 300K users(No proof), open app layer

## First-Hand Evaluation
- [x] Signed up
- [x] Tested KCL language
- [x] Tried structural workflows
- [x] documented teardown
- [x] Captured screenshots

## What They Do Well
Strong team. Geometry model built by them for mechanical engineering. They have strong investors and access to money. 

## What They Do Poorly
Messy startup. No PMF, different products, no clear selling point and revenue stream. founded in 2021 and still not impressive. Their text to CAD is not working well. 

## Pricing
Their tool is free. Only API has price: $10/month credits for free, then u pay 0.0083 per second of compute time

## Could They Pivot to Precast?
No way. Their engine is built for mechanical engineers. founder team have no experience in construction/architecture. It will take them years and whole team reconstruction to switch. 

## Key Takeaway
chaotic startup with no PMF and tough to understand what they do. They are not dangerous for us. their Text to CAD works for 3D models and not for 2D drawings.
